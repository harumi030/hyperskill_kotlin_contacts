<p>A <code class="language-kotlin">for</code> loop allows you to iterate through an entire array. Let's take a look at several ways how you can use it.</p>
<h5 id="iterating-through-an-array">Iterating through an array</h5>
<p>The simplest way to process each array element is to use the following template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">for (element in array) {
    // body of loop
}
</code></pre>
<p>Suppose we have an array that includes weekdays. Let's print each day of the week:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val daysOfWeek = arrayOf("Sun", "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat")
    
    for (day in daysOfWeek){
        println(day)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>After that, the program will print the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">Sun
Mon
Tues
Wed
Thur
Fri
Sat
</code></pre>
<p>In the same way, you can process an array of integers, characters, as well as of any other type.</p>
<h5 id="iterating-by-indexes">Iterating by indexes</h5>
<p>It is possible to access elements by their indexes directly from the loop. To do that, you must get the <code class="language-kotlin">array.indices</code> property that represents a range of valid <code class="language-kotlin">array</code> indexes.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <code class="language-kotlin">daysOfWeek</code> array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val daysOfWeek = arrayOf("Sun", "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat")

    for (index in daysOfWeek.indices){
        println("$index: ${daysOfWeek[index]}")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The program will print the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">0: Sun
1: Mon
2: Tues
3: Wed
4: Thur
5: Fri
6: Sat</code></pre>
<h5 id="iterating-by-range-indexes">Iterating by range indexes</h5>
<p>We have discussed two ways to iterate through an array. They are useful when you need to process each array element. Sometimes, you may need to access a particular subarray. You can specify the range of the indexes you need.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>The index of the first element of an array is always 0.</p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Take a look at the program below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val daysOfWeek = arrayOf("Sun", "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat")

    for (index in 1..5) {
        println("$index: ${daysOfWeek[index]}")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It will print only the workdays using a <strong>closed-ended range</strong> <code class="language-kotlin">index in 1..5</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">1: Mon
2: Tues
3: Wed
4: Thur
5: Fri</code></pre>
<p>Also, you can use <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an open-ended range is a range of numbers that goes from a starting value to a finishing value, excluding the finishing value. | The value of a variable is considered to be in the range inclusively if it is greater than or equal to the starting value and less than the finishing value. If the variable's value does not fall within the range, it will be false. To exclude the right border, you can either subtract 1 from it or use the 'until' keyword to create an open-ended range, which is the recommended way.">open-ended range</a> </strong><code class="language-kotlin">index in 1..&lt;5</code>, look atd this code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val daysOfWeek = arrayOf("Sun", "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat")

    for (index in 1..&lt;5) {
        println("$index: ${daysOfWeek[index]}")
    }
}</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">1: Mon
2: Tues
3: Wed
4: Thur
</code></pre>
<p>To use the last index of an array in ranges, you need to access <code class="language-kotlin">array.lastIndex</code>. So, we can modify the code this way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">for (index in 1 until daysOfWeek.lastIndex) {
    println("$index: ${daysOfWeek[index]}")
}</code></pre>
<p>It displays the same days as before:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">1: Mon
2: Tues
3: Wed
4: Thur
5: Fri </code></pre>
<p>If you want to iterate through an array in <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, reverse order refers to the process of sorting the elements of a collection in descending order, based on their natural order or a custom ordering method. | This can be achieved using the `reversed()` function, which returns a copy of the original collection in reverse index order, or the `reversed()` method, which returns a reference to the original collection in reverse index order. The latter does not create a new copy, but it may reflect changes made to the original collection. When working with mutable collections, one must be cautious while using the `reversed()` method to avoid unintended consequences.">reverse order</a>, use <code class="language-kotlin">downTo</code> in a range. You can also specify the offset between indexes using <code class="language-kotlin">step</code>.</p>
<p>This program below will print days in reverse order with a step of 2.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val daysOfWeek = arrayOf("Sun", "Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thur", "Fri", "Sat")

    for (index in daysOfWeek.lastIndex downTo 0 step 2) {
        println("$index: ${daysOfWeek[index]}")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">6: Sat
4: Thur
2: Tues
0: Sun</code></pre>
<p>You can iterate through an entire array or a part of it in both direct and reverse orders with any step you need.</p>
<h5 id="reading-array-elements">Reading array elements</h5>
<p>Some tasks require you to read the array elements from the input. The first element in the input here is the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an array size refers to the fixed number of elements that an array can hold. | It is a property of the array that you can obtain by accessing its value, which is of type Int. Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. However, you can modify the values of the elements in the array. To access an element in the array, you can use its index, which ranges from 0 (the first element) to array size - 1. For example, a three-element array of integers has indices 0, 1, and 2.">array size</a>, in other words, the number of array elements.</p>
<p>For example, the program below reads integer numbers and prints them in reverse order.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val size = readln().toInt()
    val array = IntArray(size)

    for (i in 0..array.lastIndex) {
        array[i] = readln().toInt()
    }

    for (i in array.lastIndex downTo 0) {
        print("${array[i]} ")
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is the input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">5
1
2
3
4
5</code></pre>
<p>The program will output the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">5 4 3 2 1 </code></pre>
<p>You can use this program as a template for your own solutions.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we have discussed ways to iterate through arrays with a <code class="language-kotlin">for</code> loop in Kotlin. We can iterate through each array element, by element indexes, and by range indexes. In this light, Kotlin gives you a lot of freedom. Some applications can require reading array elements from the input. We have covered it too.</p>
